*: WEAR: An Outdoor Sports Dataset for Wearable and Egocentric Activity Recognition, Marius Bock and Hilde Kuehne and Kristof Van Laerhoven and Michael Moeller, In Proc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol. (IMWUT), vol.8(4)2024. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3699776](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3699776)

Data from 22 participants performing a total of 18 different workout activities was collected with synchronized inertial (acceleration) and camera (egocentric video) data recorded at 11 different outside locations. As such, 751 action segments spanning over 19 hours of data were recorded, across all seasons.
